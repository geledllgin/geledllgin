In the current economic climate, alternative means of obtaining money to make ends meet are becoming increasingly necessary. Some alternatives include borrowing money from friends/relatives; cash advances from employers; pawning personal effects and payday loans. Also known as a check/cash advance loan or deferred deposit check loan, the payday loan is the most popular among these. As payday loans grown in popularity, more and more people want to know just what a payday loan is, and if it is the right solution for their situation.

SO, WHAT IS A PAYDAY LOAN?

A payday loan is an unsecured, short-term loan of anywhere from a few hundred dollars to as much as fifteen hundred dollars in some instances. A borrower generally secures the loan by post-dating a personal check for a specific amount of money to be posted against their account on their next pay period. Payday loans are designed to help out in situations when you need quick cash to cover an unexpected bill or an emergency situation until your cash comes through or is made available.
